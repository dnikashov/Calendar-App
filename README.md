# Calendar App
 
The Calendar App is an application that has precise date display and interactive user interface.

It was entirely coded in Swift and was used to develop my proficiency in Swift while gaining valuable experience in UI design and development. Added features are still being developed on the app such as the "Add Event" button which will allow the user to add personalized events and edit the events on a specific date.
